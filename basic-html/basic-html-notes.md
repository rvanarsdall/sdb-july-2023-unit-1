# HTML

- HTML document has a series of tags that we call elements.
- Most elements have open and closing tags.
- There are a few elements that are considered self closing.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Defines the document and tells the browser is is an HTML5 document

```html
<title>Basic HTML</title>
```

Title element tells the browser to display in the tab of the browser window the title.

```html
<body></body>
```

The body element is a container that will be used for displaying all the visible content to the browser.

## VS Code Shortcuts
